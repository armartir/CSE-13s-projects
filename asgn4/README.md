Assingment 4: The Towers of Hanoi
For this assingment we implemented the towers of hanoi using two methods: recursions and stack. To run the program the user must simply type make or make all and then use either the flag -s for stack implementation or flag -r for the recursion statement followed by -n x(x being a number). If you dont have a -n x flag the program will simply default to 5 rings. However, you must have a -s or a -r flag or else the program will not run. The program can theoretically run until as high of a number as you want, however the higher you get the longer it will take for the program to run.
