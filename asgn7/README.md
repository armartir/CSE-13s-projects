For this assingment we created a word scensor in which the user starts the program and either links a file or types some stuff up and the program is going to tell the user if he used words that are considered unacceptable or words that have a new translation. To start the program simply type make or make all and then either type ./newspeak <(insert.txt file here) or do ./newspeak and type up some words and when you want your words tested simply type control D when they are finished. There are also some user arguments which are types after ./newspeak <.txt whic are -s which only prints out statistics, -h and a number for the size of the hash table, -f and a number for the size of the bloom filter, -m to turn on the move to front rule, and -b to not have a move to front rule. warning I would not try to do both as I believe there can be either an error message or it will pick one at random. For More details I am also going to include a writeup.
