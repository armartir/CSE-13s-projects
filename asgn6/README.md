Assignment 6 writeup
For this assingment we take in the user arguments and create an array, the main part of this assignment is that once the array is created we have 4 different sorting algorithms which can be used in order to sort the arrays, to run the program simply type make or make all to compile and put ./sorting and select from the various flags such as -A(print all) -a(print sort a) -b(print sort b) -c(print sort c) -d(print sort d) as well as -n x(new number for number of values in the array) -r x(new number for random seed used to get the random numbers) -p x(number of elements in the array that you would like printed). Other functions are make clean which removes all of the extra files created as well as make infer which checks the program for any potential memory issues.
