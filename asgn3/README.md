assingment 3 writeup
	For this assingment we created a program which would take in a command 
line and print out a loop which would show the calculated functions for 
Sine, Cosine, Tangent, e^x. We were required to use functions to calculate the
different functions and we would compare that value to the value the library
functions would give us. In order to run the program the user simply types 
make or make all which compiles the program, then the user would type 
./math -s to print the sine functions comparison or ./math -c which would
print the cosine function comparison or the ./math -t which would print 
the tangent function comparison or the ./math -e which would print the 
comparison between e^x functions. The last command line is ./math -a which
would print out all 4 tests from sin-cos-tan-e^x. I had no problems with the
infer command, however I am struggling with the make files, that will begin to
improve.
