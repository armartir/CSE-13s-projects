Assingment 1: Temperature conversion 

For this assingment we created a program(called convert.c) which prints out a list of temperature conversions from Celsius to a variety of temperatures, for my lab I created a loop which would incriment the Celsius temperature by 10 degrees and print out the different conversions for each temperature: Kelvin, Fahrenheit, Rankine, and Delisle. We also created a makefile which compiles the program by simply typing the word 'make' then the user will type ./convert to run the program. When ran the program will print out a list of temperatures in different units.
